1.  Read definitions of roll, pitch, yaw.

2.  Never use hard-coded parameters. Try to pass the filename as a command line argument. DONE

3.  Never use the names like "my..." DONE

4.  If it is possible always initialize all private data members of a class inside the constructor of the class.
    For example: the ApiConvertKTHDB contructor should initialize the data: string filenameXML. And it
    should NOT be passed to the parsing function.  DONE

5.  "parseObject": the function is called by another function of same class which is "parseXMLfile" 
    so it should be private because it should be HIDDEN: data abstraction. DONE

6.  When designing classes, keep the same order of the private and public sections. Example: in "ApiConvertKTHDB" 
    I put private at the beginning, but in "SceneInformation" I put private at the end. DONE

7.  Always write before the code of a function a description of all the steps of the algorithm
    between the comments /* */ also using variable names, and then translate this into the actual C++ code.

8. put blankspace between variable names and & in the call by reference. DONE

9.  Initialize the data members in the NULL constructor in the SceneDescription class. DONE

10. When i have a setType function always create corresponding get function so that I can debug by 
    printing the parameter that I have previously set. Second type of debug when I do e "set". 
    Example: in the ApiConvertKTHDB::parseXMLfile function, when I call: setType.


11.  mapKTHDS should be a private variable of the class ApiConvertKTHDB.
     So I will also create 1 new function just to SET this data member of the "ApiConvertKTHDB" class.
     DONE


12.  The print can maximum be a debug statement inside a get function bcs it is childish.
     The get function can return the data or can return void and take the data as argument, 
     paased by reference.
     Example: in Object class, printBoundingBox and printCentroid should be modified.

13.  printInternalDataStructure NOT IN THIS CLASS: delete the whole function.

14.  SceneInformation: I sould add a "show" function to print and visualize the things. See test.cpp.
